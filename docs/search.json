The majority of donations are relatively small — mostly under $50 — with a sharp decline in frequency as the donation amount increases. A small number of donors gave over $100, but such large donations are rare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This figure uses a logarithmic y-axis to better visualize the heavily right-skewed distribution of donation amounts, including those who gave $0. It highlights that most donors either gave nothing or made small contributions (typically under $20), while only a few gave larger amounts. The log scale allows us to observe variation across the full range despite the large number of zero or near-zero donations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states; 0 otherwise\n\n\nnonlit\nNonlitigation\n\n\ncases\nCourt cases from state in 2004-5 in which organization was involved\n\n\nstatecnt\nPercent of sample from state\n\n\nstateresponse\nProportion of sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponset\nProportion of treated sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsec\nProportion of control sample from the state who gave\n\n\nstateresponsetminc\nstateresponset - stateresponsec\n\n\nperbush\nState vote share for Bush\n\n\nclose25\nState vote share for Bush between 47.5% and 52.5%\n\n\nred0\nRed state\n\n\nblue0\nBlue state\n\n\nredcty\nRed county\n\n\nbluecty\nBlue county\n\n\npwhite\nProportion white within zip code\n\n\npblack\nProportion black within zip code\n\n\npage18_39\nProportion age 18-39 within zip code\n\n\nave_hh_sz\nAverage household size within zip code\n\n\nmedian_hhincome\nMedian household income within zip code\n\n\npowner\nProportion house owner within zip code\n\n\npsch_atlstba\nProportion who finished college within zip code\n\n\npop_propurban\nProportion of population urban within zip code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Test\nAs an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\nAs a check on the randomization mechanism, we compare several pre-treatment covariates between the treatment and control groups.

The linear regression confirms this, with the treatment coefficient being positive and significant. These results replicate the finding in Table 2a (Panel A) of the original paper: match offers increase the likelihood of giving.\n\n\n\nThis corresponds to Table 2a, Panel A of Karlan & List (2007), where the estimated treatment effect on donation probability is also positive and statistically significant.\n\n\n\n3.

The result further supports the idea that behavioral cues—like matching funds—can meaningfully influence charitable behavior.\n\n\n\nThese results replicate Table 3, Column 1 in Karlan & List (2007), which shows that treatment assignment increases the likelihood of donating.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate. Assessing the effect of different matching ratios (1:1 vs 2:1 vs 3:1) on donation likelihood\n\n\n1.

This is consistent with the authors’ comment that “figures suggest” there’s no meaningful difference among match sizes. The barplot confirms that the donation rates are very similar across all match ratio groups, supporting the conclusion that increasing the match ratio does not substantially increase giving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

This suggests that the increase in matching ratio may have a detectable effect, but not one that is economically meaningful. A 2:1 or 3:1 match offer appears no more motivating than a 1:1 match.\nThis regression structure corresponds to Table 2a in Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

This supports the conclusion that higher matching ratios do not meaningfully increase donor participation. This regression structure corresponds to the estimation in Table 2a of Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n1.

However, this is driven by an increase in the likelihood of donating rather than an increase in how much people give once they choose to donate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Regression on Positive Donors Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nt\nP&gt;|t|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n45.540268\n2.423378\n18.792063\n5.473578e-68\n40.784958\n50.295579\n\n\ntreatment\n-1.668393\n2.872384\n-0.580839\n5.614756e-01\n-7.304773\n3.967986\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Among those who donated, the treatment effect remains positive but is much smaller. This suggests that the match incentive primarily works by encouraging more people to give, not by significantly increasing donation size. Causality is still difficult to assert due to possible selection on unobservables among donors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Histogram of Donation Amounts (Conditioned on Giving)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: The histograms show that both treatment and control groups follow a similar donation distribution, with only a small difference in average donation amounts. This visual reinforces the regression results: treatment primarily increases the chance of giving, not the donation size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: What Did We Learn?\n\n\n\n\nOn the full sample, treatment increases donation amount — but this is because more people donate, not because they give more.\nAmong those who donated, the treatment has no statistically significant impact on how much they gave.\nVisual distributions reinforce this: both groups have similar donation patterns once giving is triggered.\nIn short, the match incentive primarily influences whether people give, not how much they give."

With a fixed random seed, we observe smoother convergence behavior, reinforcing that with large enough samples, empirical means converge to theoretical expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation – CLT:\nEach histogram shows the distribution of 1,000 simulated mean differences between treatment and control groups at different sample sizes. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more concentrated and symmetric around the true mean difference. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this project, I replicate and explore findings from Karlan and List (2007), who conducted a large-scale natural field experiment to test whether and how charitable giving responds to matching donations.\nMy analysis confirms their key result: simply offering a matching grant significantly increases the likelihood that an individual donates. However, consistent with the paper’s findings, I also find that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 (to 2:1 or 3:1) does not lead to higher response rates or larger donations. This suggests that the psychological nudge of a match offer—rather than its financial magnitude—drives behavior.\nFurthermore, while treatment boosts average donation amounts on the full sample, this effect disappears when conditioning on those who gave. This indicates that matching primarily operates on the extensive margin (whether to give), not the intensive margin (how much to give).\nThrough simulation, I also illustrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, showing how statistical inference allows us to draw valid conclusions from randomized experiments.\nTaken together, these results highlight the power of simple behavioral interventions—like a matching message—to shape real-world decision making. At the same time, they reinforce the importance of rigorous experimental design and replication for understanding causal effects in charitable and policy-relevant settings."
